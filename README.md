Have you ever lost track of time while studying and ended up studying for hours straight? 

Take A Break is an application that targets those that lose track of time and end up studying or working for way too long at once. Studies have shown that taking breaks allows the brain to rest and absorb that information. Thus, in this application, through a simple selection, users can choose to study for 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, or 60 minutes before the application notifies you to take a break. The application will also remind you to get back to work through a simple notification.

During this break, grab a coffee, stretch or simply rest your mind.

What makes this different from other timer-like applications?
    - Notification when time is up (Less intrusive, your custom ringtone/vibration)
